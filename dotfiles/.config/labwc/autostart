# Lock screen after 5 minutes; turn off display after another 5 minutes.
#
# Note that in the context of idle system power management, it is *NOT* a good
# idea to turn off displays by 'disabling outputs' for example by
# `wlr-randr --output <whatever> --off` because this re-arranges views
# (since a837fef). Instead use a wlr-output-power-management client such as
